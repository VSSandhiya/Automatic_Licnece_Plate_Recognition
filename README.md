# YOLOv8-Based Automatic License Plate Recognition System

A systematic, engineering-focused approach to license plate detection and recognition using YOLOv8 with rigorous dataset validation and modular notebook development.

## Problem Statement

Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) addresses the critical challenge of automated vehicle identification through license plate detection and text extraction. Real-world ALPR systems must overcome significant obstacles including:

- **Environmental factors**: Motion blur, camera shake, and vehicle movement
- **Lighting conditions**: Low light, glare, reflections, and shadows
- **Scale variations**: Small object detection at distance vs. close-up plates
- **Occlusion and distortion**: Partial plates, angles, and perspective distortion

The detection stage represents the most challenging component of ALPR pipelines, as any failure here cascades to complete system failure. Unlike generic object detection, license plates require precise localization to enable effective OCR processing.

## Solution Overview

This project implements a systematic ALPR pipeline using YOLOv8 for license plate detection, followed by planned OCR integration. The solution emphasizes:

- **YOLOv8n selection**: Lightweight model optimized for real-time inference while maintaining sufficient accuracy for license plate detection
- **Notebook-driven development**: Incremental, modular workflow enabling systematic experimentation and validation
- **Dataset-first approach**: Rigorous validation and cleaning before model training to ensure training stability
- **Engineering rigor**: Systematic validation, confidence engineering, and pipeline-aware design decisions

## Dataset Engineering & Validation

Many ALPR projects overlook critical dataset validation steps, leading to training instability and unpredictable model behavior. This project implements systematic data quality assurance:

### Missing Label Detection
- Identified images without corresponding annotation files
- Prevents training errors from missing ground truth data
- Ensures balanced training set with complete supervision

### Empty Annotation Removal
- Detected and removed label files containing no bounding box data
- Eliminates false negative training examples
- Maintains dataset integrity for effective learning

### Bounding Box Normalization Validation
- Verified all bounding box coordinates within [0,1] range
- Ensures YOLOv8 format compliance
- Prevents coordinate system errors during training

This validation approach eliminates common failure modes in ALPR training and establishes a foundation for reliable model development.

## Model Design & Training Strategy

### YOLOv8n Selection Rationale
- **Lightweight architecture**: 3.2M parameters for efficient inference
- **Real-time capability**: Optimized for edge deployment scenarios
- **Sufficient accuracy**: Adequate performance for license plate detection task
- **Resource efficiency**: Compatible with CPU-only training environments

### Training Strategy
- **Epoch count**: Balanced for convergence without overfitting
- **Image size**: Optimized for license plate scale characteristics
- **Batch size**: Configured for available computational resources
- **Learning rate**: Standard YOLOv8 defaults with proven stability

### Trade-off Analysis
The YOLOv8n selection represents a conscious trade-off favoring deployment practicality over marginal accuracy gains from larger variants. This decision aligns with real-world ALPR requirements where inference speed and resource efficiency often outweigh absolute detection accuracy.

## Inference Strategy & Confidence Engineering

### Initial Challenge Resolution
Encountered zero-detection issues during initial testing, resolved through systematic diagnosis:
- Verified model loading and configuration
- Validated input preprocessing pipeline
- Confirmed dataset format compatibility
- Adjusted confidence thresholds based on validation analysis

### Confidence Threshold Tuning

### Top-1 Bounding Box Selection
- Designed OCR-aware detection pipeline
- Implemented highest-confidence bounding box selection
- Ensures single, high-quality plate region for downstream processing
- Eliminates multi-detection ambiguity for clean OCR input

### Pipeline-Aware Design
The inference strategy explicitly considers downstream OCR requirements:
- Single detection output prevents OCR confusion
- High confidence thresholds ensure readable plate regions
- Bounding box quality directly impacts OCR success rates
